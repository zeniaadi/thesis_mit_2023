Chapter 4 Description:
In semiconductor fab, the process of producing silicon wafers is highly complex. Wafer lots need to go through the same machines several times. There are also crucial steps and constraints within the system; thus, understanding the systemâ€™s dynamic is necessary. Machine learning techniques are utilized and proved to be useful in identifying production factors that affect the throughput level of the semiconductor lab and build accurate prediction model. By knowing the significant production factors, production managers are able to focus on the important factors to achieve the production goal with the desired product quality. 

Although it is possible to collect large amount of data in the manufacturing environment, the most common problem within manufacturing system is to pick only several features and data that can be transformed into significant actionable insight. Thus, the objective of this study would be to improve the interpretability of the machine learning insights using the interpretable machine learning method (SHAP), which would provide faster insight-to-action transformation. 

Chapter 4 details the experiments, analysis, and discussion in implementing SHAP methods to the production flow in Semiconductor fab. Six types of machine learning techniques are analyzed and compared to the SHAP analysis in representing the interpretability.
